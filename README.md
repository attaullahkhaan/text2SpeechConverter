Convert text to speech desktop application using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

Text-to-speech (TTS) converter is a software or service that converts written text into spoken words. It is often used to provide audio versions of written content, such as articles, books, or news reports, and it can be useful for people who have difficulty reading or prefer to listen to content rather than read it.
